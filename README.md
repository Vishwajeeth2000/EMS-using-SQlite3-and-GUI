Title: Employment Management System using SQlite3 and GUI

Application:

In many organizations, employment management systems are used to support staff in providing daily efforts at their best to meet organizational objectives. Employee efforts are managed and guided in the appropriate direction by it. It handles and securely keeps your employees' personal information as well as information linked to their employment. It is then simpler to store the data and get access to it when needed.

Administrative tasks may be managed more quickly and easily with the staff management system. The work that employees do eventually affects the company's bottom line, making them a crucial component of your organization. It is a crucial element in human resource management. Additionally, it boosts productivity and lowers expenses by assisting with staff engagement and performance management.

Basic idea:

Idea of designing employment management system (Using MySQL database and GUI) is for getting all the data of the employees at fingertips and to save lot of productive time without crawling through the entire employee database.

In the outline of the record system, I am planning to add the following scripts like add record, delete, save, exit, reset and display along with the catalogues (Employee reference no, Full name , Email ID , Gender , Designation, Contact number, Salary and address of the employee)

Problems to be solved:

Aim of developing this system is to deter all forms of fraud and aid the HR department in an organization's accurate compensation calculations5. Ensuring a positive staff experience and engagement. Conflicts between employees and employers frequently arise because of calculation errors, which have a negative impact on relationships and employee performance as a whole, both of which contribute to the success of a business. Therefore, this system seeks to provide easy and comfortable working conditions for employees so that organizations can develop and achieve their objectives.

Designing an employee management system is to provide a straightforward, reasonably priced, and dependable system to meet the objective of making employees attendance and wage calculations simple and accurate. To ensure that employees receive full compensation for their labour, we want to create a system that prohibits employee fraud. This system was created primarily to address the issue of small-scale enterprises and manufacturers still keeping employee data on paper and pen.

An employee management system can also help to solve the following other significant issues:

1. Employer management

2. Keeping thorough performance records for all staff.

3. Making sure that everyone is paid accurately and on schedule.

4.Tracking staff output and performance to help managers allocate resources wisely.

Implementation plan:

Modules: Functions, Database and GUI

Packages: Tkinter, OS, ttk from Tkinter (Themed Tkinter) , messagebox from Tkinter and SQlite3 database.

Dataflow and major functionalities:

* Users (HR) will provide employee information in the respective catalogues like Employee reference no, Full name, Email ID, Gender, Designation, Contact number, Salary and address.

* Python program what I have created will read the information what user has given and display that in employee details GUI widget.

* Then user can perform different functions like add, delete, save, exit, reset and display the record by clicking on the respective message boxes.

* I am planning to add one more message box like print (print the document in any format so it will be easy to send the information to employee through email or any platforms by HR).

Input: Employee information into the respective catalogues or dialogue boxes.

Output: Information which feeded will display on the employee details widget box separately which is used for performing different functions like add, delete, save, exit, reset, display and print the record.
